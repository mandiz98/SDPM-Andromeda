# DSDM Summery
DSDM’s success is due to the philosophy “that any project must be aligned to clearly defined strategic goals and focus upon early delivery of real benefits to the business.” Supporting this philosophy with the eight principles allows teams to maintain focus and achieve project goals.

## The eight Principles of DSDM:

- Focus on the business need
- Deliver on time
- Collaborate
- Never compromise quality
- Build incrementally from firm foundations
- Develop iteratively
- Communicate continuously and clearly
- Demonstrate control

## Practices
DSDM is vendor-independent, covers the entire lifecycle of a project and provides best practice guidance for on-time, in-budget delivery of projects, with proven scalability to address projects of all sizes and for any business sector.

DSDM advocates the use of several proven practices, including:

- Facilitated Workshops
- Modelling and Iterative Development
- MoSCoW Prioritisation
- Time boxing
